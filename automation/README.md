## Launch Sidecar

[launchSidecar.scpt](https://github.com/petehannon/my.useful-scripts/blob/main/automation/launchSidecar.scpt) utilises AppleScript to automatically launch and click through MacOS UI items. It will open the Sidecar pane, and select the first device in the list. You could also extend the script to select by device name if you desire.
